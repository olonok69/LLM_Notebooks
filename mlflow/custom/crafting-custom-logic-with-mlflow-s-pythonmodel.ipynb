    "The python_function model flavor serves as a default model interface for MLflow Python models. Any MLflow Python model is expected to be loadable as a python_function model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the mlflow.pyfunc module defines a generic filesystem format for Python models and provides utilities for saving to and loading from this format. The format is self contained in the sense that it includes all necessary information for anyone to load it and use it. Dependencies are either stored directly with the model or referenced via a Conda environment.\n",

    "# Function-based Model vs Class-based Model\n",
    "When creating custom PyFunc models, you can choose between two different interfaces: a function-based model and a class-based model. In short, a function-based model is simply a python function that does not take additional params. The class-based model, on the other hand, is subclass of PythonModel that supports several required and optional methods. If your use case is simple and fits within a single predict function, a funcion-based approach is recommended. If you need more power, such as custom serialization, custom data processing, or to override additional methods, you should use the class-based implementation."
